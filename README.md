This project is a Doctor Appointment System (Mobile) app designed to help users book doctor appointments in the most efficient way. Rather than calling up centers, paying a visit or using complex appointment systems for the sake of making an appointment, users can just chat with an AI powered Chatbot with (NLP and ML) entity and intent recognition, to help users make appointments the most efficient way.

> [!NOTE]
> This app was developed in order to submit it as a final project for my final year at IIUC (International Islamic University Chittagong), hence this project requires a lot more work to be fully developed for deployment. It is made open-source for learning purposes, my team and I will soon make proper tutorials, documentation, and deploy proper code (as it is all messy due to lots of trials and errors) in a seperate repository. So, please star this repository if you would want to keep up with the updates! Any contributions are welcomed, please e-mail me beforehand, Thank you.
